...........................UNDERSTANDING OF DIRECTORIES.........................................
First check your current working directory
>pwd    --->/home/nida

- Now create directory with name "linux" in your current directory.
>mkdir linux 

 create a another directory  with name "Assignment-01" inside your "linux" directory
 >cd linux
 >mkdir Assingment-01
 
 Now create one more directory inside "/tmp" with name "dir1" without changing your present directory.
- At last create two more directories having below tree structure .It should create a below structure via single command only .
```
/tmp
  - dir1
      - dir2
        - dir3
        
> mkdir /tmp/dir1
>mkdir -p /tmp/dir1/dir2/dir3       #The -p option ensures that the parent directories are  
                                     created if they do not exist.for dir3,dir2 is parent.
                                     for dir2 ,dir1 is parent.
                                     
Find a command  that will delete a "dir3" that you have created before.
>rmdir /tmp/dir1/dir2/dir3       

Now create a empty file with your "firt-name"  in /tmp directory.
>touch sia


- After creating a empty file , add "This is my first line " into a file without using any editor.
>echo "this is my first line." >> sia     #sia is my file name.

- Now add  one more line "this is a additional content " into a same file .Make sure it will not overwrite the previous line of the file.        
>echo "This is additional content." >> sia
          
Then  create new  file with your  "last-name" along with some content like "last-name is my last name".Do not use any editor
>touch roy
>echo ""ROY" is my last name.." >> roy
>cat roy                #to see the content.

- Now add "this is line at the  beginning" into "last-name" file  in such a manner that it will add the line at beginning of the file.Do not use any editor.
>echo "this is line at the begining" | cat - roy > temp && mv temp roy 

- Then add some more 8-10  lines to the same file .
echo -e  "which then concatenates it . \n The result is redirected to a  (temp).\n hello how are you.\n apple.\n mango." >> roy

 Now find a command that will show:
  - top 5 lines of the file.
  >head -n 5 roy
  
  - bottom 2 lines of the  file.
  >tail  -n 2 roy.
  - only 6th line  of the file.
  >head -n 6 roy | tail -n 6
  
  - 3-8 lines of the file .
  >head -n 8 roy | tail -n 6
  
  
  - Find a command that will list  below things of /tmp directory
  >ls -l
  - list all content(including hidden files)
  >ls -la
  - list only files
  > ls -p /tmp | grep -v /
  - list only directories
  >ls -l /tmp | grep '^d'   #^d uses here because a line starts with d is directory in file   
                                 permission.
  
  - Now copy the "last-name" into the /tmp/dir2 with same name.
  >cp -p roy dir1/dir2 
- Then again copy the "last-name" into the /tmp/dir2, this time with different name i.e "last-name".copy
>cp roy roy.copy
- Now change the name of the "first-name" file  to some other name at same location .
>cp sia sia.copy
- Find a command that will  move the "last-name" file  to /tmp/dir1
>sudo mv roy dir1/

- find a command that will clear the content of /tmp/dir2/"last-name".copy .Make sure it will not even contain  empty line .
>echo "" > roy.copy
- Now delete the same file i.e /tmp/dir2/last-name.copy
>rm -r roy.copy
Note : Do not use sed command in this assignment.
